## Components architecture

**Atomic Components**: At the atomic level, you can have reusable components such as buttons, inputs, labels, etc. These components should focus on a single responsibility and be highly customizable.

**Molecules**: Molecules are made up of atomic components and are slightly more complex. They combine atomic components to create more specific UI elements or functionality.

**Organisms**: Organisms are higher-level components that combine molecules and atoms to create sections or sections of your UI. They can represent specific features or parts of a page.

**Templates**: Templates define the structure of a page or a section of a page. They bring together organisms and provide the overall layout and composition for pages.

**Pages**: Pages are the top-level components that represent the different routes or views in your application. They use templates and integrate with the Next.js routing system.
